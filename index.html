                  Opened as the first theme park at Walt Disney World, Magic
                  Kingdom is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The
                  park is represented by its central icon, Cinderella Castle,
                  and is laid out in a hub-and-spokes configuration, similar to
                  Disneyland. The park consists of seven lands: Main Street,
                  U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square,
                  Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.

                  This resort, easily identified by its A-frame main building,
                  was one of two that opened with the Magic Kingdom in 1971.
                  Located adjacent to the Magic Kingdom (and easily accessible
                  by monorail or walking path), it features a modern,
                  contemporary design theme, and contains a multi-story mosaic
                  designed by Disney Legend Mary Blair. There are currently
                  several restaurants at the Contemporary Resort, including
                  California Grill, a signature restaurant located on the
                  resort's top floor.

                  Resort from 1985 to 2014, this resort has undergone a number
                  of renovations and updates, including the addition of several
                  new longhouses. A recent addition included the opening of
                  Trader Sam's Grog Grotto, a tiki-themed bar featuring
                  signature drinks and special effects, inspired by a similar
                  bar at the Disneyland Hotel in California.

                  This steamboat, named for a retired Naval Admiral who played
                  an important part in the building of Walt Disney World, ran on
                  the Rivers of America in Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square until
                  1980, when it was damaged in a dry dock. Since a second
                  steamboat had since been added to the Magic Kingdom, Disney
                  decided to break up the Fowler for scrap.

                  This attraction featured passenger vehicles based on the
                  Nautilus design from the 1954 Disney adaptation of 20,000
                  Leagues Under The Sea, where passengers were seated below the
                  water level and were able to view underwater show scenes. In
                  different parts of the attraction, guests could see moray
                  eels, crabs, lobsters, sea bass, clams, turtle, smaller
                  tropical fish, shipwrecks, deepwater fish, a sea serpent,
                  mermaids, and a giant squid. The attraction temporarily closed
                  in 1994 without any advance notice, with the closure
                  officially made permanent in 1996.

                  Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, featured travel destinations
                  throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere. The ride had a popular

                  shortly after the airline withdrew its sponsorship. A slightly
                  changed version of the attraction, called If You Could Fly,
                  opened on June 6, 1987, but it would close less than two years
                  later, in January 1989.

                  This island, later renamed Discovery Island, was a zoological
                  park located in Walt Disney World's Bay Lake. It was open to
                  guests as an attraction, where they could observe its many
                  species of animals and birds. After Discovery Island closed in
                  April 1999, the animals were moved to Disney's Animal Kingdom,
                  and the island was allowed to deteriorate.

                  This rocket-spinner attraction, opened as part of a massive
                  expansion in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The attraction
                  involves rockets spinning around a central monument, with each
                  of 12 open-air vehicles holding up to two passengers who
                  circled round and round, 60 feet above the ground, while
                  controlling their ascent and descent with a metal control
                  stick. The attraction underwent a major redesign in 1994 and
                  reopened with the name Astro Orbiter.

                  This attraction, created by Walt Disney and WED Enterprises
                  for the General Electric (GE) Pavilion at the 1964 New York
                  World's Fair, was located at Disneyland from 1967 until 1973,
                  when it was closed and moved to Florida. The attraction's
                  premise is an exploration of the joys of living through the
                  advent of electricity and other technological advances during
                  the 20th century via a "typical" American family and features
                  the Sherman Brothers' song "There's a Great Big Beautiful
                  Tomorrow."

                  This show, located in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, was
                  designed in cooperation with NASA. Guests were "launched" on a
                  spacecraft into space and approached the surface of the red
                  planet Mars. The attraction closed on October 4, 1993 and was
                  replaced by ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter.

                  This attraction, themed as an urban mass transit system of the
                  future, the ride takes passengers on a tour around the second
                  floor of many attractions in Tomorrowland. Riders will also
                  see a large diorama containing a portion of the Progress City

                  Disney's first water park, River Country featured a rustic
                  wilderness theming, complete with rocks and man-made boulders.
                  The park featured five water slides, two pools, and two
                  children's areas. The park never reopened after its regular
                  end-of-season closure in November 2001, and on January 20,
                  2005, The Walt Disney Company announced that the park was
                  permanently closed. The park has since been left to
                  deteriorate.
