                  Opened as the first theme park at Walt Disney World, Magic
                  Kingdom is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The
                  park is represented by its central icon, Cinderella Castle,
                  and is laid out in a hub-and-spokes configuration, similar to
                  Disneyland. The park consists of seven lands: Main Street,
                  U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square,
                  Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.

                  This resort, easily identified by its A-frame main building,
                  was one of two that opened with the Magic Kingdom in 1971.
                  Located adjacent to the Magic Kingdom (and easily accessible
                  by monorail or walking path), it features a modern,
                  contemporary design theme, and contains a multi-story mosaic
                  designed by Disney Legend Mary Blair. There are currently
                  several restaurants at the Contemporary Resort, including
                  California Grill, a signature restaurant located on the
                  resort's top floor.

                  Resort from 1985 to 2014, this resort has undergone a number
                  of renovations and updates, including the addition of several
                  new longhouses. A recent addition included the opening of
                  Trader Sam's Grog Grotto, a tiki-themed bar featuring
                  signature drinks and special effects, inspired by a similar

                  This steamboat, named for a retired Naval Admiral who played
                  an important part in the building of Walt Disney World, ran on
                  the Rivers of America in Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square until
                  1980, when it was damaged in a dry dock. Since a second
                  steamboat had since been added to the Magic Kingdom, Disney
                  decided to break up the Fowler for scrap.

                  This attraction featured passenger vehicles based on the
                  Nautilus design from the 1954 Disney adaptation of 20,000
                  Leagues Under The Sea, where passengers were seated below the
                  water level and were able to view underwater show scenes. In
                  different parts of the attraction, guests could see moray
                  eels, crabs, lobsters, sea bass, clams, turtle, smaller
                  tropical fish, shipwrecks, deepwater fish, a sea serpent,
                  mermaids, and a giant squid. The attraction temporarily closed
                  in 1994 without any advance notice, with the closure
                  officially made permanent in 1996.

                  throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere. The ride had a popular

                  shortly after the airline withdrew its sponsorship. A slightly

                  opened on June 6, 1987, but it would close less than two years
                  later, in January 1989.

                  This island, later renamed Discovery Island, was a zoological
                  park located in Walt Disney World's Bay Lake. It was open to
                  guests as an attraction, where they could observe its many
                  species of animals and birds. After Discovery Island closed in
                  April 1999, the animals were moved to Disney's Animal Kingdom,
                  and the island was allowed to deteriorate.

                  This rocket-spinner attraction, opened as part of a massive
                  expansion in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The attraction
                  involves rockets spinning around a central monument, with each
                  of 12 open-air vehicles holding up to two passengers who
                  circled round and round, 60 feet above the ground, while
                  controlling their ascent and descent with a metal control
                  stick. The attraction underwent a major redesign in 1994 and
                  reopened with the name Astro Orbiter.

                  The Morocco Pavilion, the first expansion pavilion to be added
                  to World Showcase, was designed to look like a Moroccan city
                  with a realistic Minaret. It is the only pavilion in which the
                  country's government aided in the design, as King Hassan II
                  sent Moroccan artisans to design and create the many mosaics.
                  Due to Islamic religious beliefs on the content of art, the
                  mosaics contain no representations of people, and the
                  pavilion's buildings do not light up during nighttime shows.

                  This World Showcase pavilion, situated between the Mexican and
                  Chinese pavilions, is designed to look like a Norwegian
                  village. The village includes a detailed Stave church,
                  Restaurant Akershus (the exterior of which resembles its
                  namesake in Oslo), and a series of interconnected shops
                  decorated with large wooden trolls, which sell assorted
                  Norwegian goods, including clothing, candy, and statuettes of
                  Norse gods and trolls.

                  The third theme park to open at Walt Disney World, Disney-MGM
                  Studios is dedicated to the facets of show business, including
                  film, television, music, and theatre. The park opened as part
                  theme park and part production studio, with animated features
                  such as Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and Brother Bear being produced
                  there. Several sound stages were used for both Disney and
                  outside projects. In the 2000's, these production facilities
                  began to shut down, and eventually the park was no longer used
                  for any filming or production. In January 2008, MGM branding
                  was removed from the park, which was renamed Disney's
                  Hollywood Studios. A major expansion was announced in 2015,
                  with Toy Story Land and Star Wars Land being announced for the
                  park.

                  paradise. The centerpiece of the park is "Miss Tilly," a
                  shrimp boat impaled upon a mountain named "Mount Mayday" that
                  erupts a 50-foot (15 m) geyser of water every half hour, right
                  before the bells of the watch sound on Miss Tilly. The park
                  operates year-round, with an annual closure for maintenance.

                  housed two major attractions (Cranium Command and Body Wars),
                  as well as other entertainment and interactive attractions.
                  Cranium Command, a theater show with audio-animatronic actors
                  and a movie, explained the functions of the brain and its
                  interaction with the human body. Body Wars was a motion
                  simulator ride taking guests on a Fantastic Voyage-like trip
                  through the bloodstream. The pavilion moved to seasonal
                  operation beginning on January 4, 2004 and closed permanently
                  on January 1, 2007. The building is now used for special
                  events and festivals.

                  This pavilion, which opened with Epcot on October 1, 1982, was
                  pavilion dedicated to technological advances. Having debuted
                  at the dawn of the modern computer era, the emphasis
                  throughout CommuniCore was primarily on educating the public
                  about computers. The feature exhibit was a tour through EPCOT
                  Computer Central, the computer hub of EPCOT Center that ran
                  nearly everything throughout the park. The pavilion closed to
                  be replaced by Innoventions, a more eclectic, wild, and
                  corporate-driven take on a Science and Technology pavilion.

                  This film, shown in the Harvest Theater in The Land pavilion,
                  features Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa from
                  <em>The Lion King</em> explaining how some actions are harmful
                  to nature. This lesson is explained with a mixture of
                  live-action and animated footage. It replaced Symbiosis, a
                  similarly themed film.

                  This water park is themed to a ski resort created after a
                  freak snowstorm which later melted. The majority of the major
                  attractions at the park are hosted atop of Mount Gushmore, an
                  artificial hill with an elevation of 90 feet, where the
                  attractions are divided into three areas - Green Slope, Purple
                  Slope, and Red Slope. The park's flagship attraction, Summit
                  Plummet, is located on Green Slope. There are also attractions
                  at ground level, as well as food and beverage areas.

                  Omnimover vehicles, and would be taken through scenes that

                  This opening-day Magic Kingdom dark ride, based on Disney's
                  adaptation of <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, contained two
                  separate ride experiences, based on where you boarded. Mr.
                  Toad's Wild Ride was replaced with The Many Adventures of
                  Winnie the Pooh. Minor tributes to the ride can be found in
                  Disney World, including paintings of Mr. Toad and Moley within
                  the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh attraction and a statue
                  of Toad in a pet cemetery outside of Haunted Mansion.
