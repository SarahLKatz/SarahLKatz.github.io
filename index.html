                  Opened as the first theme park at Walt Disney World, Magic Kingdom is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The park is represented by its central icon, Cinderella Castle, and is laid out in a hub-and-spokes configuration, similar to Disneyland. The park consists of seven lands: Main Street, U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.

                  This resort, easily identified by its A-frame main building, was one of two that opened with the Magic Kingdom in 1971. Located adjacent to the Magic Kingdom (and easily accessible by monorail or walking path), it features a modern, contemporary design theme, and contains a multi-story mosaic designed by Disney Legend Mary Blair. There are currently several restaurants at the Contemporary Resort, including California Grill, a signature restaurant located on the resort's top floor.

Known as the Polynesian Resort from 1985 to 2014, this resort has undergone a number of renovations and updates, including the addition of several new longhouses. A recent addition included the opening of Trader Sam's Grog Grotto, a tiki-themed bar featuring signature drinks and special effects, inspired by a similar bar at the Disneyland Hotel in California.

In different parts of the attraction, guests could see moray eels, crabs, lobsters, sea bass, clams, turtle, smaller tropical fish, shipwrecks, deepwater fish, a sea serpent, mermaids, and a giant squid. The attraction temporarily closed in 1994 without any advance notice, with the closure officially made permanent in 1996.

The ride had a popular eponymous theme song by Buddy Baker. The attraction was sponsored by Eastern Airlines, and would close in 1987, shortly after the airline withdrew its sponsorship. A slightly changed version of the attraction, called If You Could Fly, opened on June 6, 1987, but it would close less than two years later, in January 1989.

The attraction involves rockets spinning around  a central monument, with each of 12 open-air vehicles holding up to two passengers who circled round and round, 60 feet above the ground, while controlling their ascent and descent with a metal control stick. The attraction underwent a major redesign in 1994 and reopened with the name Astro Orbiter.

                  The Morocco Pavilion, the first expansion pavilion to be added to World Showcase, was designed to look like a Moroccan city with a realistic Minaret. It is the only pavilion in which the country's government aided in the design, as King Hassan II sent Moroccan artisans to design and create the many mosaics. Due to Islamic religious beliefs on the content of art, the mosaics contain no representations of people, and the pavilion's buildings do not light up during nighttime shows.

                  The third theme park to open at Walt Disney World, Disney-MGM Studios is dedicated to the facets of show business, including film, television, music, and theatre. The park opened as part theme park and part production studio, with animated features such as  Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and Brother Bear being produced there. Several sound stages were used for both Disney and outside projects. In the 2000's, these production facilities began to shut down, and eventually the park was no longer used for any filming or production. In January 2008, MGM branding was removed from the park, which was renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios. A major expansion was announced in 2015, with Toy Story Land and Star Wars Land being announced for the park.

Body Wars was a motion simulator ride taking guests on a Fantastic Voyage-like trip through the bloodstream. The pavilion moved to seasonal operation beginning on January 4, 2004 and closed permanently on January 1, 2007. The building is now used for special events and festivals.

                  The carousel, located in Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland, is renamed to better fit the story behind the attraction. According to the official backstory, the carousel was inspired by a device built by Prince Charming to assist him in training for the ring-spearing event at jousting matches. A second carousel was built closer to the castle to allow villagers to try their hand at this device. With this new backstory, park visitors were invited to test their horsemanship skills and to enjoy their own happy ending while riding the carousel.
