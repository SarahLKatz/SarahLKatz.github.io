                  Opened as the first theme park at Walt Disney World, Magic
                  Kingdom is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The
                  park is represented by its central icon, Cinderella Castle,
                  and is laid out in a hub-and-spokes configuration, similar to
                  Disneyland. The park consists of seven lands: Main Street,
                  U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square,
                  Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.

                  This resort, easily identified by its A-frame main building,
                  was one of two that opened with the Magic Kingdom in 1971.
                  Located adjacent to the Magic Kingdom (and easily accessible
                  by monorail or walking path), it features a modern,
                  contemporary design theme, and contains a multi-story mosaic
                  designed by Disney Legend Mary Blair. There are currently
                  several restaurants at the Contemporary Resort, including
                  California Grill, a signature restaurant located on the
                  resort's top floor.

                  Resort from 1985 to 2014, this resort has undergone a number
                  of renovations and updates, including the addition of several
                  new longhouses. A recent addition included the opening of
                  Trader Sam's Grog Grotto, a tiki-themed bar featuring
                  signature drinks and special effects, inspired by a similar
                  bar at the Disneyland Hotel in California.

                  This steamboat, named for a retired Naval Admiral who played
                  an important part in the building of Walt Disney World, ran on
                  the Rivers of America in Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square until
                  1980, when it was damaged in a dry dock. Since a second
                  steamboat had since been added to the Magic Kingdom, Disney
                  decided to break up the Fowler for scrap.

                  This attraction featured passenger vehicles based on the
                  Nautilus design from the 1954 Disney adaptation of 20,000
                  Leagues Under The Sea, where passengers were seated below the
                  water level and were able to view underwater show scenes. In
                  different parts of the attraction, guests could see moray
                  eels, crabs, lobsters, sea bass, clams, turtle, smaller
                  tropical fish, shipwrecks, deepwater fish, a sea serpent,
                  mermaids, and a giant squid. The attraction temporarily closed
                  in 1994 without any advance notice, with the closure
                  officially made permanent in 1996.

                  Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, featured travel destinations
                  throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere. The ride had a popular

                  shortly after the airline withdrew its sponsorship. A slightly
                  changed version of the attraction, called If You Could Fly,
                  opened on June 6, 1987, but it would close less than two years
                  later, in January 1989.

                  This island, later renamed Discovery Island, was a zoological
                  park located in Walt Disney World's Bay Lake. It was open to
                  guests as an attraction, where they could observe its many
                  species of animals and birds. After Discovery Island closed in
                  April 1999, the animals were moved to Disney's Animal Kingdom,
                  and the island was allowed to deteriorate.

                  This rocket-spinner attraction, opened as part of a massive
                  expansion in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The attraction
                  involves rockets spinning around a central monument, with each
                  of 12 open-air vehicles holding up to two passengers who
                  circled round and round, 60 feet above the ground, while
                  controlling their ascent and descent with a metal control
                  stick. The attraction underwent a major redesign in 1994 and
                  reopened with the name Astro Orbiter.

                  The Morocco Pavilion, the first expansion pavilion to be added
                  to World Showcase, was designed to look like a Moroccan city
                  with a realistic Minaret. It is the only pavilion in which the
                  country's government aided in the design, as King Hassan II
                  sent Moroccan artisans to design and create the many mosaics.
                  Due to Islamic religious beliefs on the content of art, the
                  mosaics contain no representations of people, and the
                  pavilion's buildings do not light up during nighttime shows.

                  This World Showcase pavilion, situated between the Mexican and
                  Chinese pavilions, is designed to look like a Norwegian
                  village. The village includes a detailed Stave church,
                  Restaurant Akershus (the exterior of which resembles its
                  namesake in Oslo), and a series of interconnected shops
                  decorated with large wooden trolls, which sell assorted
                  Norwegian goods, including clothing, candy, and statuettes of
                  Norse gods and trolls.

                  This log flume dark ride, located in the Norway pavilion in
                  Epcot's World Showcase, took riders through scenes featuring
                  audio-animatronic figures representing Norway's history and
                  culture. The ride vehicles were patterned after longships and
                  went forwards, backwards, and up a lift hill. The ride closed
                  on October 5, 2014, to be replaced by an attraction based on
                  the film <em>Frozen</em>.

                  The third theme park to open at Walt Disney World, Disney-MGM
                  Studios is dedicated to the facets of show business, including
                  film, television, music, and theatre. The park opened as part
                  theme park and part production studio, with animated features
                  such as Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and Brother Bear being produced
                  there. Several sound stages were used for both Disney and
                  outside projects. In the 2000's, these production facilities
                  began to shut down, and eventually the park was no longer used
                  for any filming or production. In January 2008, MGM branding
                  was removed from the park, which was renamed Disney's
                  Hollywood Studios. A major expansion was announced in 2015,
                  with Toy Story Land and Star Wars Land being announced for the
                  park.

                  Disney's second water park, Typhoon Lagoon is themed to a
                  typhoon that wreaked havoc upon a formerly pristine tropical
                  paradise. The centerpiece of the park is "Miss Tilly," a
                  shrimp boat impaled upon a mountain named "Mount Mayday" that
                  erupts a 50-foot (15 m) geyser of water every half hour, right
                  before the bells of the watch sound on Miss Tilly. The park
                  operates year-round, with an annual closure for maintenance.

                  This attraction, located in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, was
                  sponsored by Delta Air Lines. Using a basic Omnimover ride
                  system, Dreamflight was a pop-up book version of the history
                  of flight using simplistic sets, some Audio-Animatronics and
                  projection effects. The attraction closed on January 5, 1998
                  and was replaced by Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin.

                  This pavilion, which was centered around health and fitness,
                  housed two major attractions (Cranium Command and Body Wars),
                  as well as other entertainment and interactive attractions.
                  Cranium Command, a theater show with audio-animatronic actors
                  and a movie, explained the functions of the brain and its
                  interaction with the human body. Body Wars was a motion
                  simulator ride taking guests on a Fantastic Voyage-like trip
                  through the bloodstream. The pavilion moved to seasonal
                  operation beginning on January 4, 2004 and closed permanently
                  on January 1, 2007. The building is now used for special
                  events and festivals.
